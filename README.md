# Phonebook Application

This is the solution for the Part 11 exercise 11.20 and 11.21 of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC from the University of Helsinki.

For these two exercises, I created a CI/CD pipeline for the phonebook application which was already build in part 2 and part3 of the course.

I fixed the linting issues, added 2e2 tests, deployed the application, and so on.
